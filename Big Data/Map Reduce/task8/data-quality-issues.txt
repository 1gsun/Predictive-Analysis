1. In the task5, the result is useless because it returns  a blankplate. I think the data quality can be better improved to remove these missing value information. 2. This data is original in .csv file, which is supposed to be comma separated. However, there some plates contain comma in the value. First, I think these must be wrong information, as I have never seen any comma in a plate. Second, I think there should be some filter to better control the quality. 3. For task3, i believe the violation code 999 is also an error/missing code. The data should be better cleaned since 999 is heavily weighted in the data sample and will cause mis-interpretation of the real situtation.
